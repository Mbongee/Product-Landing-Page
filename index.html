                <p>On-ear headphones (also called “Supra-aural” headphones) are popular because they can be made using
                    lightweight materials. They present a nice portable alternative to bulkier over-ear models. They also
                    give you that more natural “open” sound. This tends to let more of the environment in since they don’t
                    completely close off the surroundings like (closed) over-ear models. They are also a bit more portable
                    than full over-ear headphones and offer some comfort advantages as well.</p>

                <p>In-ear headphones, or earphones, are, first and foremost, extremely portable. Because the drivers are so
                    small and the enclosures not very large, they can be coiled up and stored in a case. Often, these cases
                    come in the size of an ambitious wet-nap. You can put them right in your pocket. I don’t care how
                    compact a pair of on-ear headphones claim to be, it’s not going to match the true portability of a good
                    set of in-ears. For frequent travelers, the advantage of these earphones is obvious.</p>
